<h1>Good news: Codename &quot;Internal Eternal&quot; first demo release:</h1>
<p>During February and March I polished my demo, and this demo will be listed in Itch.io search and GameJolt (since I decided to release also in GameJolt).</p>
<p>Previously, this demo was available only via a link (and even earlier - with a password, as was stated in previous post)
Also it was a Showcase, not a Demo.</p>
<p>Now I stated, that this is a first Demo. Then may be second demo, third demo... until the full release (if the project survives)</p>
<p>Also, I no longer build the game of Web - you can build from source a Web build, if you want...</p>
<h1>Bad news: possible removal of SCP: Site Online and TGPY Game from public.</h1>
<p>Sometime in the future, I will hide both TGPY Game and SCP: Site Online (for it's possible copyright violations).</p>
<p>I decided to hide TGPY Game for it's bad quality (NOT TO BE CONFUSED with TGPY project, which got recently renamed to Miniprojects).
I made a mistake, when was developing base TGPY Game (but eventually learned lessons), because I didn't notice the problem that broke multiplayer, arised when I tried to make a sandbox game.
Also, both in TGPY Game and SCP: Site Online has the possible copyright problem, related to CC-BY-SA license (the first has SCP-173 from SCP Unity, and the latter is an SCP game) (I discussed that problem in 2024.11.08 blog)</p>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<ol>
<li>I revamped my website - now it looks more like a personal page. Or a portfolio.</li>
<li>Large SCP-related projects are frozen indefinitely (The current SCP-Wiki quality... meh...). Maybe I'll return in the future, maybe not.</li>
</ol>
